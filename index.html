            <h2>Tool Description</h2>
            <p>The scatterplot shows the relationship between happiness score and contributing factors. Since the question asks whether there is any pattern/relationship scatterplot is a good way to capture the pattern. On X axis, countries' happiness Scores lie. On Y axis, 6 factors contributing to make life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia lie. Each dot represents a country, with x happiness score and y percent of chosen factor contributing to make life evaluations. Dots are colored by regions, showing a pattern, if there is, of where each region lies. When each dot is hovered, its country name and its happiness rank show. Through the graph, users can perceive each country's happiness score, happiness rank, each region's distribution, the factor's contribution to each country's happiness score, and the relationship between happiness score and each factor's contribution. </p>
            <p>The controlling element have six different factors that contribute to judging happiness scores. Users can see each factor in relation to happiness score by clicking buttons. The tool allows users to perceive whether each factor contributing more in judging happiness affects the happiness score. It also allows the users to see how much each factor contributes differently. It also shows that for some factors, such as economy and family, countries with higher happiness scores have more consistent number percentage of contribution, while countries with lower happiness scores have various contribution values.</p>
